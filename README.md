=============

Robot navigation is a major research area in the field of mobile robotics. This is considered to be the first step in making a robot completely autonomous. Robot navigation means a robot is able to move from starting point to destination point in real environment.  In real time application of mobile robots where environment around the robot are highly complex and dynamic, the navigation system used should be able to cope with the uncertainties which are both internal and external.  A general automotive navigation system is a satellite navigation system designed for use in automobiles. It typically uses GPS to acquire position data to locate the user on a road in the units map data-base, on the other side an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) is a system designed to perform an unmanned travel of a vehicle. This vehicle can be used in many areas especially dangerous places such as harbor, surveying and military purposes. The purpose of the project is to make prototype of an AGV which uses GPS navigation instead of using camera, laser, or gyroscope.
